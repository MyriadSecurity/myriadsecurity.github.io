If you're a small business or nonprofit in the Kansas City area, you've probably heard you need a "vulnerability scan"—but what does that actually mean?

**Short version:** a vulnerability scan is an automated check of your systems for known security weaknesses. Think of it like a routine safety inspection.

### What it finds
- Missing patches and outdated software
- Misconfigurations that expose services to the internet
- Default or weak settings that attackers commonly exploit

### What it doesn't do
- It doesn’t exploit or “hack” your systems
- It’s not a penetration test

### Why it matters
Scans help you **prioritize fixes** so you reduce the chances of a breach with the **least disruption** to your business.

### How we help
