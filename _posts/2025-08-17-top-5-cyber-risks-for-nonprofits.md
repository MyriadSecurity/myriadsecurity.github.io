Nonprofits face the same threats as larger organizations—but with tighter budgets and leaner teams. Here are five high‑impact risks and quick wins:

1. **Phishing & Business Email Compromise**  
   *Win:* Turn on MFA for email and admin accounts first.
2. **Unpatched Systems**  
   *Win:* Patch monthly; focus on internet‑facing systems and remote access tools.
3. **Weak Passwords**  
   *Win:* Enforce password managers and MFA; disable legacy authentication.
4. **Overexposed Cloud Files**  
   *Win:* Audit sharing links; restrict “anyone with the link”.
5. **Shadow IT & Vendors**  
   *Win:* Maintain a simple SaaS inventory; review admin access quarterly.
