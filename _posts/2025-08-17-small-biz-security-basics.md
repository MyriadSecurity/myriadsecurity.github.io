Here are five low-effort, high-impact improvements we recommend to nearly every small org:

1. **MFA everywhere**: Email, payroll, VPN, cloud admin. Start with admins and finance.
2. **Patch the big rocks**: Browsers, VPN/firewall firmware, remote-access tools.
3. **Asset inventory**: A single spreadsheet is fine; know what you have to protect.
4. **Admin access**: Remove local admin on endpoints; use just-in-time elevation.
5. **Backups**: 3-2-1 rule with at least one offline or immutable copy; test restores quarterly.
